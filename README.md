PSD TO WORDPRESS
In this project I converted a PSD TO WORDPRESS using Advanced Custom Fields and Custom Post Types. How did I make it?

I sliced the images and I took the font properties  from PSD.
I created a subfolder for this theme in wp-content/themes
I created the front-page.php and every section of this page
I made a contact form using contact form 7 plugin
I made a portfolio section where the owner can upload pictures and assigned them to the specific categories
I made it responsive for all devices(phone(Android, iPhone, Windows Phone), tablet, desktop))
I made it cross browser (for Chrome, Mozilla, Opera, IE, Safari)
I made it pixel perfect
